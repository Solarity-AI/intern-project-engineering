# 📱 Product Review Full-Stack Application

Welcome to the **Product Review Application**! This project is a comprehensive full-stack ecosystem designed to demonstrate modern software architecture, clean code principles, and seamless cross-platform integration.

The system allows users to explore products, manage wishlists, interact with an AI Assistant for review analysis, and submit real-time feedback.

See: [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) for full setup and architecture details.

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```
*   Press **'w'** for Web version.
*   Press **'a'** for Android Emulator.
*   Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** for physical device testing.

### 4. iOS Native App Setup
```bash
cd ios
xcodegen generate              # Generate Xcode project from project.yml
open ProductReview.xcodeproj   # Open in Xcode
# Select target device (iPhone 16 Pro recommended) → Cmd+R to build & run
```
*   The app auto-connects to the deployed backend in release builds and `localhost:8080` in debug builds.
*   See [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) for detailed architecture and feature documentation.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The project follows a **Layered Clean Architecture** to ensure maintainability and testability.

### Backend (Spring Boot)
*   **Controller Layer:** REST API design with versioning and DTO mapping.
*   **Service Layer:** Business logic encapsulation with Dependency Inversion.
*   **Data Layer:** Spring Data JPA with optimized SQL queries for filtering and aggregation.
*   **Security:** Centralized CORS configuration, Bucket4j rate limiting (60 req/min per client), production profile with H2 console disabled.
*   **Error Handling:** Custom exception classes with structured `ErrorResponse` (timestamp, code, message, details).

### Frontend — React Native (Mobile/Web)
*   **State Management:** React Context API for Wishlist, Search, and Notifications.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adaptive layouts for Mobile (Android/iOS) and Web (Vercel).
*   **Networking:** Centralized API service with race-condition protection and abort controllers.

### Frontend — iOS Native (Swift/SwiftUI)
*   **Architecture:** MVVM with Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers).
*   **Networking:** URLSession with async/await, exponential backoff retry, and connectivity monitoring.
*   **UI Components:** Reusable components including shimmer loading, toast notifications, animated heart buttons, and rating stars.
*   **Utilities:** Haptic feedback, theme management, image caching (NSCache, 50MB), and search history persistence.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 🛒 Advanced Product Management
*   **Server-Side Pagination:** Efficiently handles large datasets for both main product list and user wishlist.
*   **Dynamic Multi-Filter:** Search by name and filter by category simultaneously at the database level.
*   **Global Statistics:** Real-time dashboard showing total reviews and average ratings across the platform.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Insights
*   **AI Assistant:** Interactive chat interface to ask specific questions about product reviews.
*   **AI Summary:** Automated sentiment analysis and summary of user feedback.

### 👤 User Experience (UX)
*   **Search History:** Persistent search overlay for quick access to previous queries.
*   **Multi-Select Wishlist:** Batch actions for managing favorite products.
*   **Auto-Refresh:** Real-time UI updates immediately after submitting a review without manual reload.
*   **Dark Mode:** System-wide theme support with persistent user preference.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Production Environment
*   **Mobile App:** Distributed via **EAS Build (APK)** with **OTA Updates** support.

### Why Render.com + Vercel?
**Render.com** (Backend):
- ✅ Completely free (750 hours/month)
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ GitHub integration
- ✅ Health check support
- ⚠️ Cold start (~30-60s for first request)

**Vercel** (Frontend):
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Global CDN
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ Edge functions
- ✅ Zero configuration

### Deployment Workflow
The project includes automated CI/CD integration:
- Push to `main` branch triggers automatic Vercel production deployment
- Backend updates deploy automatically via Render.com GitHub integration
- Pull requests create preview deployments for testing
- See deployment guides for detailed instructions

### Quick Deploy Commands
**Backend (Render.com):**
```bash
# Already configured with render.yaml
# Just connect your GitHub repo on render.com dashboard
```

**Frontend (Vercel):**
```bash
cd mobile
npm install -g vercel  # Install Vercel CLI
vercel login           # Login to Vercel
vercel --prod          # Deploy to production
```

### Color Palette (Updated 2026-01)
The application features a professional, modern color system with WCAG AA compliance:

**Light Mode:**
- Primary: `#0066FF` (Vibrant Blue - trustworthy, modern)
- Background: `#FAFAFA` (Soft neutral for reduced eye strain)
- Accent: `#4F46E5` (Professional Indigo)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: `#3B82F6` (Softer blue for dark mode)
- Background: `#0A0A0A` (OLED optimized)
- Accent: `#C7D2FE` (High contrast indigo)

All colors maintain optimal contrast ratios for accessibility standards.

## 🎓 Internship Assignment

Future interns are expected to:
1.  Understand the **Backend API** provided in this repository.
2.  Implement a **Native Frontend** (iOS/Swift or Android/Kotlin) that matches the features of the React Native reference implementation.
3.  Refer to `mobile/README-iOS-Swift.md` or `mobile/README-Android-Kotlin.md` for specific requirements.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

*   **Port 8080 Conflict:** If the backend fails to start, check if another process is using port 8080.
*   **Network Issues:** Ensure the `BASE_URL` in `mobile/src/services/api.ts` matches your backend IP (use local IP for physical devices).
*   **Vercel 404 on Refresh:** Fixed via `vercel.json` rewrites. If issues persist, ensure the file is in the `mobile/` root.
*   **iOS — XcodeGen:** If the `.xcodeproj` is missing, install XcodeGen (`brew install xcodegen`) and run `xcodegen generate` inside the `ios/` directory.
*   **iOS — Simulator:** Requires Xcode 15.0+ and macOS Sonoma (14.0+). Target device must be iOS 17.0+.
